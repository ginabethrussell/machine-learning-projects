# Housing Price Prediction

This project demonstrates a simple machine learning workflow to predict housing prices based on features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, and location.

## Goals
- Explore the dataset.
- Perform data cleaning and feature engineering.
- Train a regression model to predict housing prices.
- Evaluate model performance.
